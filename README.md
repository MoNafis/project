# Group-project
This is the CS1 Project for amazingly pro-coders, only the elite make up the team.
this team has faced it all, harsh criticism, blunt accusations and foremost, naive prejudice, throughout the years no one liked doing projects, but we never said no to a challenge, so when we suceeded every single time people envied us.Few unfortunate events led to aother and something tragic happened, We had failed to complete a super dooper high intense mind boggling, muscle itching, spine chilling and heart exploding mission to complete a project in time.This happened only once and we were drowned with rave speeches and bullying courtesies.All it took was one mistake for things to fall sideways, into the abyss of sorrow regrets and regretabble yesterdays, But here we stand with our code in one hand and python shell in the other, we strive for better tomorrows as well as clean meaningful code structures.We aim for the high skies of error-less code, we dream for it with every single push of an enter button, the rush of blood flowing thorugh our tireless veins, pulsating at every thought that all of this just would lead to a recursive downfall, in a never ending cycle for all of us to experience. this feeling of emptiness is all we have to learn from and move on.But at the end of the day we pave our paths to a brighter terminal waiting for us to use them and sort out the profound mysteries of lazy users and their weapon of choice EVill input. when seaching for the TRUE meaning we have to remove the inefficient redundancies that most often than not lead to false answers.at the end we just gotta swap and replace file with life continuously and while we are at it we gotta append and remove all the unecessities so we dont interate over the same objects that hinder our thought process.After all this, if none of it works out, in ourselves we must believe and try to weather the storm because we are the ONES that decide what defines us and the root to acess that truness runs within ourselves, no matter what is assigned to us. So we take our stand against unfruitful memories that bug us while we manoeuvre through the stacks of obstacles and heaps and remember that we have to show our Class or else we have linked ourselves to failure.We are the trees that bear exceptional ideas and fruitful conditions that enable us to return to the top of the world.for what its worth, listing out all the blatant, brutal and banal things people have thrown at us we are everything except all that. No matter the cost or difficulty we will ride through the deserted lands of useful knowledge and prosperity because we are amazingly crtical, resourcefully unbeatable, undoubtly competent, wonderfully resistant and most of all we dont never ever EVER give up, we are 'The Inevitables'.
